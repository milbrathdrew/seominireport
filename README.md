### Database Schema Updates
We've enhanced the database schema to properly store SEO analysis data:
- Added `priority_fixes` column to the reports table for better tracking of high-impact recommendations
- Added additional JSON fields (`technical_details`, `action_items`, `comparison_data`) to support comprehensive reporting
- Fixed type definitions to match between client and server code

### Action Plan Improvements
- Created a structured admin action plan page that categorizes SEO recommendations
- Added implementation timeline divided into phases (Quick Wins, Strategic Improvements, Long-term Projects)
- Enhanced filtering and sorting capabilities for actionable items

### Error Handling
- Improved error handling in the API routes with proper fallback reports
- Added better logging for debugging issues
- Fixed non-null assertion errors in components

## Coming Soon: Enhanced SEO Analysis
We're working on implementing real website analysis with the following improvements:

1. **Server-side Web Crawler**: Replace placeholder analysis with actual page content analysis
2. **Metadata Analysis**: Evaluate real page titles, meta descriptions, and other metadata
3. **Content Structure Analysis**: Analyze heading structure (H1-H6), images, and content quality
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Perform basic accessibility checks for better scoring
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Check if websites are mobile-friendly

These improvements will provide distinct, accurate scores between different websites instead of relying on basic URL structure analysis.
