# PR: Clean up unused implementations and focus on client-compatible analyzer

## Description

This PR removes unused code and dependencies related to previous implementation attempts, focusing the codebase around the client-compatible SEO analyzer that works reliably across environments.

## Changes Made

- Removed old server-dependent SEO analyzer implementation
- Removed PDF generation functionality (deferred to future phase)
- Removed email delivery functionality (deferred to future phase)
- Removed unused test scripts and API endpoints
- Cleaned up package.json by removing unused dependencies:
  - cheerio
  - @react-pdf/renderer
  - nodemailer
  - @types/nodemailer
  - axios
  - chrome-launcher
  - lighthouse
- Updated documentation to reflect current implementation status

## Motivation and Context

The previous implementation relied on server-side modules that were causing compatibility issues with Next.js. This PR streamlines the codebase to focus on the client-compatible implementation that works reliably across environments without external dependencies.

## How Has This Been Tested?

- Verified the web server starts correctly
- Confirmed the client-side SEO analyzer works properly
- Tested API endpoints to ensure they function correctly
- Checked for any console errors or warnings
- Created a comprehensive test plan in TEST-PR.md

## Additional Notes

- Supabase integration requires proper credentials in `.env.local`
- Database-dependent features (lead/report storage) require proper Supabase setup
- This cleanup paves the way for enhanced UI display components in the next phase

## Next Steps

1. Implement enhanced UI display components for SEO analysis results
2. Prepare for deployment configuration
3. Enhance SEO analysis with additional metrics and recommendations
