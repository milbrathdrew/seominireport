## Updated Approach

Based on implementation challenges, we've updated our approach:

- **Simplified SEO Analysis**: Focus on creating a reliable analyzer that works in both client and server contexts
- **Immediate UI Feedback**: Display detailed analysis results directly in the UI rather than generating PDFs
- **Deferred PDF/Email**: Move PDF generation and email delivery to a future phase

## In Progress

### Enhanced SEO Analysis UI Display

## Technical Challenges

1. **Module Compatibility Issues**
   - Encountered issues with Next.js compatibility with certain npm modules
   - The cheerio library dependencies (undici) use private class fields syntax (#target) 
     that's not fully supported in the current build configuration
   - Implemented a client-compatible solution that works without problematic dependencies

## Up Next

### Enhanced UI Results Display

- Create visual score representations
- Add expandable sections for technical details
- Include actionable recommendations with guidance

### Deployment Configuration
- Configure environment variables for production
- Set up monitoring and error tracking
- Prepare for initial deployment
