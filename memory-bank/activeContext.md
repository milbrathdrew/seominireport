   - Creating and refining the report data structure

2. **PDF Generation and Email Delivery**
   - Selecting and implementing PDF generation library
   - Creating report templates
   - Setting up email delivery service

3. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Setting up production Supabase instance
   - Configuring Vercel deployment
   - Setting up environment variables

## Recent Completions

1. **Supabase Integration**

   - Created database schema and migration files
   - Added functionality to store leads and reports
   - Created health check endpoint for monitoring
   - Added comprehensive documentation for Supabase setup

2. **Form Validation and UI Implementation**
   - Implemented comprehensive form validation using react-hook-form and zod
   - Created reusable UI components (Button, FormInput, Alert)
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Implemented ReportCard component for displaying results
   - Set up client-side API integration
   - Created form submission handling with proper state management

3. **Technical Debt Resolution**
   - Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration issues
   - Downgraded to Next.js 14.1.0 for better stability
   - Simplified CSS approach to avoid compatibility problems
   - Corrected PostCSS configuration for proper integration
   - Updated dependencies to compatible versions

## Implementation Decisions

1. **Supabase Integration Approach**
   - Created separate utility module for Supabase operations
   - Used TypeScript types for database entities
   - Implemented error handling for database operations
   - Added health check endpoint for monitoring connection status
   - Created comprehensive SQL setup scripts with migrations

2. **Database Schema Design**
   - Created two main tables: leads and reports
   - Used UUID as primary key for better security and distribution
   - Implemented proper foreign key relationship between leads and reports
   - Added indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Implemented Row Level Security for data protection

3. **Form Validation Approach**
   - Used zod for schema validation due to its TypeScript integration
   - Implemented client-side validation to provide immediate feedback
   - Created reusable components to maintain consistency
   - Added clear error messages to guide users

4. **State Management**
   - Used React's useState for managing form and submission state
   - Created appropriate types for form values and state
   - Implemented proper loading and error states
   - Used conditional rendering for different form states

5. **CSS Configuration**
   - Simplified Tailwind CSS configuration to avoid compatibility issues
   - Used direct color values rather than CSS variables where needed
   - Added animations using Tailwind utility classes
   - Ensured consistent styling across components

6. **API Integration**

   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Structured API responses for easy consumption
   - Added database storage for form submissions

## Open Questions

1. **SEO Analysis Implementation**
   - How should we integrate Lighthouse in a serverless environment?
   - Which specific metrics should we prioritize for the report?
   - How can we optimize performance for faster analysis?

2. **Report Format**
   - Should reports be delivered primarily as PDFs or as interactive web pages?
   - What visualization components would make the data most understandable?
   - How much educational content should be included in reports?

3. **Lead Management**
   - What follow-up process should be implemented after report generation?
   - Should we implement a dashboard for viewing past reports?
   - What metrics should we track about user engagement with reports?

## Next Steps

1. **SEO Analysis Implementation (Immediate Focus)**
   - Research optimal Lighthouse API integration
   - Create feature branch for SEO analysis
   - Implement basic analysis in API route
   - Expand the report data structure as needed

2. **PDF Generation**
   - Select appropriate PDF library (React-PDF or similar)
   - Design report template
   - Implement PDF generation in API route
   - Add download functionality to the UI

3. **Production Setup**
   - Create production Supabase instance
   - Run migration scripts to set up database
   - Configure environment variables for production
   - Set up monitoring and logging
