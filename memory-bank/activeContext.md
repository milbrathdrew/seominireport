# Active Context: Minimalist SEO Report Generator

## Current Development Focus
We have completed the initial setup phase of the SEO Report Generator project. The current focus is on:

1. **Form Implementation and Validation**
   - Adding client-side form validation
   - Implementing form submission logic
   - Creating loading states and success/error feedback
   - Enhancing the form UI with animations

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Setting up Supabase project and database tables
   - Implementing database connections 
   - Creating data models for leads and reports

3. **SEO Analysis Implementation**
   - Researching best approach for Lighthouse integration
   - Implementing the analysis logic
   - Creating the report data structure

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected Next.js for frontend and API routes to simplify architecture
   - Chosen Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
   - Selected Supabase for database due to its simplicity and PostgreSQL foundation
   - Decided to use React-PDF for report generation

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) that focuses on core functionality
   - Prioritizing user experience and visual design from the beginning
   - Planning for incremental feature additions after core functionality is established

3. **Branching Strategy**
   - Documented comprehensive Git branching strategy in `branchingStrategy.md`
   - Following GitFlow-inspired approach with main, develop, and feature branches
   - Established commit message conventions following conventional commits format
   - Will strictly adhere to the defined workflow for all feature development

4. **Project Structure**
   - Using Next.js App Router for routing and API endpoints
   - Structured the project with clear separation of concerns
   - Created placeholder components and API routes to establish patterns

## Completed Setup

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Initialized Git repository with main and develop branches
   - Set up basic Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Created directory structure following best practices

2. **UI Foundations**
   - Implemented placeholder landing page with form
   - Set up Tailwind CSS with custom colors and animations
   - Created responsive layout structure

3. **API Foundations**
   - Created placeholder API route for report generation
   - Established pattern for request validation and error handling
   - Defined mock response structure

## Open Questions

1. **SEO Analysis Depth**
   - How comprehensive should the initial SEO analysis be?
   - Which metrics provide the most value to users with minimal technical knowledge?
   - What is the right balance between analysis speed and thoroughness?

2. **Report Format**
   - Should reports be delivered primarily as PDFs or as interactive web pages?
   - What visualization components would make the data most understandable?
   - How much educational content should be included in reports?

3. **Lead Management**
   - What follow-up process should be implemented after report generation?
   - How should we handle repeat users/websites?
   - What metrics should we track about user engagement with reports?

## Next Steps

1. **Form Validation (Immediate Focus)**
   - Create feature branch for form validation
   - Implement client-side validation for all fields
   - Add loading states and submission handling
   - Provide clear error messages and visual feedback

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Create database tables for leads and reports
   - Implement database connection in API route

3. **SEO Analysis Implementation**
   - Research Lighthouse API integration options
   - Implement basic SEO analysis in the API route
   - Create report data structure and visualization
