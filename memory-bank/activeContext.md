# Active Context: Minimalist SEO Report Generator

## Current Development Focus
We are in the initial setup phase of the SEO Report Generator project. The current focus is on:

1. **Project Infrastructure Setup**
   - Setting up Next.js project structure
   - Configuring Tailwind CSS
   - Setting up Supabase connection
   - Establishing environment variables

2. **Core Landing Page Development**
   - Creating responsive layout
   - Implementing form components with validation
   - Designing loading/success/error states
   - Implementing subtle animations for improved UX

3. **API Routes Implementation**
   - Setting up report generation endpoint
   - Connecting to Lighthouse API
   - Implementing basic SEO analysis logic
   - Setting up PDF generation

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected Next.js for frontend and API routes to simplify architecture
   - Chosen Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
   - Selected Supabase for database due to its simplicity and PostgreSQL foundation
   - Decided to use React-PDF for report generation

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) that focuses on core functionality
   - Prioritizing user experience and visual design from the beginning
   - Planning for incremental feature additions after core functionality is established

3. **Branching Strategy**
   - Documented comprehensive Git branching strategy in `branchingStrategy.md`
   - Will follow GitFlow-inspired approach with main, develop, and feature branches
   - Established commit message conventions following conventional commits format
   - Will strictly adhere to the defined workflow for all feature development

## Open Questions

1. **SEO Analysis Depth**
   - How comprehensive should the initial SEO analysis be?
   - Which metrics provide the most value to users with minimal technical knowledge?
   - What is the right balance between analysis speed and thoroughness?

2. **Report Format**
   - Should reports be delivered primarily as PDFs or as interactive web pages?
   - What visualization components would make the data most understandable?
   - How much educational content should be included in reports?

3. **Lead Management**
   - What follow-up process should be implemented after report generation?
   - How should we handle repeat users/websites?
   - What metrics should we track about user engagement with reports?

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Initialize repository with proper branch structure
   - Set up basic project structure and dependencies
   - Create landing page UI components
   - Implement form validation logic
   - Set up Supabase tables and connection

2. **Near-Term Milestones**
   - Complete working form submission flow
   - Implement basic Lighthouse analysis
   - Create initial report template
   - Set up email delivery system

3. **Technical Debt Considerations**
   - Need to implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Plan for caching strategy to handle repeat analyses
   - Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set up monitoring for API performance and failures
