# PR Testing Plan: Cleanup Old Implementations

This document outlines the testing steps for the PR to merge the `cleanup-old-implementations` branch.

## Prerequisites

- Next.js development environment
- Supabase project with proper credentials (for full testing)
- Modern web browser

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Server Functionality

- [ ] Clone the repository
- [ ] Checkout the `cleanup-old-implementations` branch
- [ ] Install dependencies with `npm install`
- [ ] Start the development server with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify the server starts without errors
- [ ] Access the homepage at http://localhost:3000

### 2. Client-Side SEO Analyzer Functionality

- [ ] Navigate to the homepage
- [ ] Verify the SEO form is displayed
- [ ] Submit the form with test data:
  - URL: `https://example.com`
  - Email: `test@example.com`
  - Name: `Test User`
- [ ] Verify the analysis completes and results are displayed
- [ ] Toggle between simple and detailed views
- [ ] Verify all scores and recommendations are displayed correctly

### 3. API Endpoint Testing

- [ ] Test the analyze-url endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}' \
    http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-url
  ```
- [ ] Verify the response contains the expected analysis data
- [ ] If Supabase credentials are configured, test the generate-report endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"https://example.com", "email":"test@example.com", "name":"Test User"}' \
    http://localhost:3000/api/generate-report
  ```

### 4. Cleanup Verification

- [ ] Verify no console errors appear in the browser console
- [ ] Verify no import errors appear in the terminal
- [ ] Check network requests to ensure no 404 errors for missing endpoints

### 5. Regression Testing

- [ ] Submit multiple URLs for analysis
- [ ] Test URL variations (with/without HTTP, www, query parameters)
- [ ] Verify form validation works correctly for invalid inputs
- [ ] Check that all UI components render correctly and are responsive

## Expected Results

1. The application should start and run without errors
2. SEO analysis should work correctly using the client-compatible analyzer
3. No references to removed components should appear in the code
4. All core functionality should work as expected
5. If Supabase is properly configured, report storage should function correctly

## Notes

- Supabase integration requires proper credentials in `.env.local`
- The cleanup focuses on removing unused implementations while maintaining core functionality
- Primary testing goal is to ensure the client-compatible SEO analyzer works correctly
